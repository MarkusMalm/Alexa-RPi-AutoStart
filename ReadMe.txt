My name is Wayne Courtney.
I am an Electronics Technician for over 30 years now.
I was always interested in Electronics and graduated from Metropolitan Technical Institute back in 1977.
I live in Mahawh, NJ amd work with designing circuits and building computers in my spare time.
I had some programming in school, but just started getting into some basic programming with the Paspberry Pi.

I saw your videos on YouTube and interested me very much!
I was very interested in the "Alexa On Rasberry Pi" project.
I was able to get mine to work, folloing your procedure and was very easy to comprehend and understand.
On that note, I figured out a way to get "Alea" to work without typing in the 3 seperate commands and with no terminals on the desktop, plus autoboot!
You only have to type in a few commands to update, upgrade and download the "Alexa aPP" from github.

I wrote a detailed procedure for a "Newbee" and a brief summery for an advanced user.I will also include all the required files in a .zip folder.
I spent some time to get everything working and had to rewrite the working procedure many times, the best way that I could.
Please feel free to rewrite the procedure as necessary in your own words.
You have my permission to use the files and procedures in your presintations and videos, as I do not have a YouTube account and not too good with presenting things to a large audience.

I will plan to try to get "Alexa to work on bluetooth and to try to install "Alexa" on a Raspbian lite! This will take me some time though.
Good luck and have fun! Hope to hear from you soon!

Best Regards, Wayne.
